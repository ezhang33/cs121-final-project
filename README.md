Data used in cardealershipdb was AI generated by asking ChatGPT to 
generate 100 rows of each of the attributes for each of the 14 tables
in my schema. Adjustments were then made accordingly, such as
changing the format of phone numbers, making dealership locations
more realistic, having only 10 dealers and randomly distributing
cars into one of the 10 dealers (instead of having 100 dealers
with 1 car per 1 dealer), and more.

To load data, put the 14 CSVs into a folder named 'data'. Then run
source setup.sql;
source load-data.sql;
